<p>
    First ,we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>
<h2>Headings</h2>
<p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>
<h3>Lists</h3>
<p>This is how you make an unordered list: 
<ul>
    <li>Add a "ul" element(it stands for unordered list)</li>
    <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
    <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
</p>
</ul>
<p>This is what an ordered list looks like:
<ol>
    <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
    <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
    <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
    <li>You should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
</p>
</ol>

<h3>Inline Elements</h3>
<p>
<em>Sometimes</em>,you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.
Other times, yoyu need to <strong>strongly</strong> emphasize the importance of a word or phrase.</strong>
</p>
<h3>Empty Elements</h3>
